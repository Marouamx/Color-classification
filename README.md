# Color-classification 

controlling a 4 axis robotic arm using an arduino micro-controller to clasify cubes according to thier color.

the detection process is done by an LDR (photoresistor) + RGB LED.

an ultrasonic sensor is added here so that whenever the cube is not
 in the detection area nothing happens.
